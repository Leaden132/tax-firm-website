      <h2 class="section-title">Common Cross-Border Tax Situations</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">Every cross-border tax situation is unique. Here are some scenarios where our expertise makes a difference.</p>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I'm an American living in Toronto. Do I still need to file US taxes?</summary>
          <p>Yes. The US taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of where they live. You must file a US tax return (Form 1040) and may also need to file FBAR, FATCA (Form 8938), and other information returns for your Canadian accounts, RRSPs, and TFSAs. The good news is that treaty provisions and foreign tax credits can significantly reduce or eliminate your US tax liability.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I own rental property in the US. What are my obligations?</summary>
          <p>Canadian residents who earn rental income from US property must file a US tax return (Form 1040-NR) to report this income. You may also need to file state returns depending on the property location. The rental income must also be reported on your Canadian tax return, with a foreign tax credit for US taxes paid.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What happens to my RRSP if I move to the US?</summary>
          <p>Under the Canada-US Tax Treaty, your RRSP can be tax-deferred in the US if you make a proper treaty election (Form 8891 is no longer required, but the election must still be documented). Without this election, the IRS may tax the annual growth in your RRSP. We ensure proper reporting on both sides.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I work remotely for a US company from Canada. How am I taxed?</summary>
          <p>As a Canadian resident, you're taxed on your worldwide income by the CRA. The US company may or may not withhold US taxes depending on the arrangement. We determine your filing obligations in both countries and ensure you're not being double-taxed on this income.</p>
